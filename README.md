# hackerrank-30-days-of-code-python
As I decide to take a chance on learning about Python, this repository serves the HackerRank challenge of 30 days of code in Python, where every day I will make a new commitment with a new challenge.

# Challenges

There are two scenarios to visualize the challenges:

- 1 - Each challenge is separated by file.
Ex: **day_0_hellow_world.py**

In each file you can see the code inserted in the platform and the other details of the challenge.

- 2 - In the **main.py** file, the challenges class is imported, which is located in the **challenges.py** file. In the challenges file, for each challenge there is a method for each one of them, and you can visualize it as follows:

>**challenges = Challenges()
>challenges.day_0_hello_world()**

After you call the method, you will be able to view the answers to the challenges.
Após você chamar o método, você poderá visualizar as respostas dos desafios.
